Cambridge Spacefinder UI
==============

This repository is a fork off the UoL Spacefinder UI. The original SpaceFinder (https://github.com/cambridge-collection/spacefinder) was built on a Ruby on Rails framework and shared as an open-source project, subsequently, the UoL redeveloped the project to a "UI only" site, removing the Ruby backend. This fork is then based on the UoL version, customised back with Cambridge data.

The major change made to the original application (https://github.com/cambridge-collection/spacefinder/) is the decoupling of the application into User Interface and server-side components. Here, the data for all spaces is served as JSON files rather than using a data endpoint driven by a server-side application.
