### About this site

This site contains a rewrite of the code in the Cambridge application's UI to make a single page application fed by a single JSON data file which loads data for all spaces (instead of loading them from a Rails API). The project was initiated by the University of Leeds library to explore the possibility of using the Cambridge app in Leeds, but adoption of the full Rails stack was not possible at the time.
